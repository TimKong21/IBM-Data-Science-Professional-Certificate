    "**Two types of plotting layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the video lectures, there are two styles/options of ploting with `matplotlib`. Plotting using the Artist layer and plotting using the scripting layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Scripting layer (procedural method) - using matplotlib.pyplot as 'plt'**\n",
    "\n",
    ">You can use `plt` i.e. `matplotlib.pyplot` and add more elements by calling different methods procedurally; for example, `plt.title(...)` to add title or `plt.xlabel(...)` to add label to the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Artist layer (Object oriented method) - using an `Axes` instance from Matplotlib (preferred)**\n",
    "\n",
    ">You can use an `Axes` instance of your current plot and store it in a variable (eg. `ax`). You can add more elements by calling methods with a little change in syntax (by adding \"_set__\" to the previous methods). For example, use `ax.set_title()` instead of `plt.title()` to add title,  or `ax.set_xlabel()` instead of `plt.xlabel()` to add label to the x-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    ">This option sometimes is more transparent and flexible to use for advanced plots (in particular when having multiple plots. \n",

    "In vertical bar graphs, the x-axis is used for labelling, and the length of bars on the y-axis corresponds to the magnitude of the variable being measured. Vertical bar graphs are particuarly useful in analyzing time series data. One disadvantage is that they lack space for text labelling at the foot of each bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal Bar Plot**<br>\n",
    "Sometimes it is more practical to represent the data horizontally, especially if you need more room for labelling the bars. In horizontal bar graphs, the y-axis is used for labelling, and the length of bars on the x-axis corresponds to the magnitude of the variable being measured. As you will see, there is more room on the y-axis to  label categetorical variables."

    "A `scatter plot` (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each other. `Scatter` plots look similar to `line plots` in that they both map independent and **dependent** variables on a 2D graph. While the datapoints are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a **trend**. With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset."

The datapoints are replaced with bubbles, and the size of the bubble is determined by the third variable 'z', also known as the weight. In `maplotlib`, we can pass in an array or scalar to the keyword `s` to `plot()`, that contains the weight of each point."
