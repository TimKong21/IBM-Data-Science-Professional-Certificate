***Data science Displayed on a Dashboard***

In this assignment, you are a data scientist working at a real estate investment trust. The trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. You are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. You will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on. A template notebook is provided in the lab; your job is to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions are given in the template notebook. You will use Watson Studio to perform the analysis, and share an image of your finished Jupyter notebook with a URL.

***Dashboard Analytics Displayed***

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying authentic data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment.

***Watson Studio***

You also have the option to store the Dashboard on IBM object storage so anyone can view the Dashboard; however, you will not be marked on this aspect. The next sections will set you up with IBM object storage. You will need Watson Studio to share your results. You will be creating a project with Watson Studio. If you have already signed up for Watson Studio, you will still have to get the notebook link at the end of the section.

***Notebook URL***

Create a notebook in Watson Studio and use the option From URL to import the final notebook. Copy the link given below:

https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/PY0101EN_Coursera_FinalAssignment.ipynb

and paste it in Notebook URL. As you import the notebook, dataset is within the notebook itself in links dictionary.

***Review criteria***

There are ten questions. Simple questions are worth one mark and harder questions are worth two marks. For each item, you should take a screen shot of the output of each cell with the code that generated it. The provided code must be run. Most of the questions are independent i.e. if you miss one you can still do the rest of the problems. You will also be asked to share your notebook. You will also receive marks for displaying your notebook.

***Jupyter Notebook Viewer***

paste the link to the GitHub notebook into http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ in order to display interactive plots.
